You... you tricked me! |Hey, I techinically didn't do that...
It's you..! All this time!! |Woah hold on, don't throw hands just yet..!
Thats true... Does this mean.. I just get your stamp of approval then? |Yes.
Can you then sneak me into the Forbidden Section of the Archives then? |Why would you want that? Just use the stamps.
