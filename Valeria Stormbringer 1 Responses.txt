It's a me, a Detective. |( . . . )
Just your average Detective. |( . . . )
The Shopkeeper told me to find you. I need access into the Forbidden Section in the Archives. |That Shopkeeper...
Shopkeeper said I could look for you to get into the Forbidden section... |That Shopkeeper...
So... how can I get access? |Let me see, it's been awhile since I heard of that place.
Can you sneak me in? |You're very funny!
Uhh.. What would I have to do to get this stamp? |You'll have to do something that will cost you your life...
Can you just give it to me? No? What do I have to do then... |Again, you're very funny!
Right... Since you're the strongest person huh. |Damn right! Now, let's fight!
Noooooo!!! I hate Combat! |What better way for I, the strongest person in the land, to give a challenge?
