What's up buddy? It's been awhile since we met.
No, you can't take this case. You're a retired General. I am already responsible for Cedric's death.
This case is a tough one to crack. I don't want to be responsible for your death too.
Are you really sure you're up for the task? Weren't you one of the Generals who fooled around during your prime?
Fine. I will let you handle this case to avenge Cedric. To help you, I will give you a few leads I have found.
Cedric was a well known War-Hero that was idolised by Humans. But for the Reptilians, not so.
It's suspected that Cedric was killed by Magic. Dark Magic. You will have to find out more in The Archives.
