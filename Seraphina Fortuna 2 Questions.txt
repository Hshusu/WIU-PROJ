Damn... You ended up winning! I thought luck would be on my side today...
Wait a minute... this coin... it's One Sided!
HAHA! You actually got me! Although, it's not you, it's probably Aurelius isn't it?
You didn't know? Aurelius is the only person in this land who could trick me! He resides as a Shopkeeper now...
Oh.. he sent you on this small journey? That's pretty smart and funny of him! Here is your stamp of approval then.
Go back to him at the Emporium, he should give you his stamp of approval.
