Of course, I am both strong and lucky! |*I wonder if this person has beaten Valeria yet...*
I definitely won fairly! |Hm..?
Oops.. you caught me... |That's actually pretty clever!
Great... would you still give me your end of the deal? |Of course, I did not say you couldn't cheat!
Aurelius? Who?? Where?? |Oh um...
That name sounds familiar... |You've heard of him..?
Oh my god.. all this time? |You mean you were talking to him this whole time? That's even funnier!!
Wow... I mean, at least I have the 2 other stamps of approval... |He is indeed a genius isn't he?
Thank you. What do I do now? |( . . . )
I feel guilty, I won by cheating... |( . . . )
