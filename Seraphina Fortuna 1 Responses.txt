Another person that expected me-! |Is it that surprising? I merely guessed...
Are you sure you're not the Shopkeeper in disguise? |Hm..? Shopkeeper?
Um... okay... |Is that surprising?
The Shopkeeper suggested me to go to Valeria since he said that you'd be hard to find... |Well, he isn't wrong!
I need to get your stamp of approval to enter the Forbidden Section in the Archives. |Oh...
Can you sneak me into the Forbidden Section of the Archives-? |Uh.. You're kind of asking a tall order here...
Yes. What do I have to do to get it? |Well... let me see...
Can you just give it to me, please? |I'm sorry but, just being polite is not going to cut it...
Heads or Tails... won't you probably win? |Thats uncertain... it's all a probability!
What a weird game, don't you have the advantage? |Let me explain...
Let's see... the shop had weird stuff... *Oh yeah... that coin!* |Wizardly Emporium? They surely do sell weird stuff.
I'll be right back... |Uh.. okay, don't take too long...
