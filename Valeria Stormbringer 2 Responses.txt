Of course, I'm stronger than people say! |That's good for you! Looks like i've found a strong contender finally!
That was a piece of cake. |Ouch.. that does hurt a little...
Great! |Just wondering, how about coming by once in awhile to spar with me a little?
You bet! |Can I ask something of you? Which is to come by once in awhile to spar with me?
Thank you! |You're welcome.
I have 2 more stamps to get... |I'd bet you could get them easily if you could beat me!
What spell in the Forbidden Section scares you the most? |Oh, uh, I hate mental spells, so definitely Possession!
Do you know where Aurelius is? |Hmm...The last i've seen of him was that he decided to live an ordinary life.
That's great! On to the next stamp it is! |You're welcome, again!
Awesome! |You're welcome, again!
